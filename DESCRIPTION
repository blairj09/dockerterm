Description: dockerterm provides an RStudio Addin to run Docker containers in 
    the RStudio terminal. The primary purpose is to run R code in a specified
    environment although other use cases certainly exist. This package strives
    to be lightweight and relatively dependency free. It does depend on a
    fairly recent version of Docker in order to operate properly.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.4)
